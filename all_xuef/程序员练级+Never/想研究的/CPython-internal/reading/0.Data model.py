##3.1. Objects, values and types
"""
Objects are Python’s abstraction for data. All data in a Python program is represented
by objects or by relations between objects.
(In a sense, and in conformance to Von Neumann’s model of a “stored program computer,”
code is also represented by objects.)
全 tm 是对象，代码也是也被表示为 对象！


Every object has an identity, a type and a value. An object’s identity never changes
once it has been created; you may think of it as the object’s address in memory.
The ‘is’ operator compares the identity of two objects; the id() function returns
an integer representing its identity (currently implemented as its address).
An object’s type is also unchangeable. [1] An object’s type determines the operations
that the object supports (e.g., “does it have a length?”) and also defines the possible
values for objects of that type. The type() function returns an object’s type
(which is an object itself). The value of some objects can change. Objects whose value
can change are said to be mutable; objects whose value is unchangeable once they are
created are called immutable. (The value of an immutable container object that contains
a reference to a mutable object can change when the latter’s value is changed;
however the container is still considered immutable, because the collection of objects
it contains cannot be changed. So, immutability is not strictly the same as having an
unchangeable value, it is more subtle.) An object’s mutability is determined by its type;
for instance, numbers, strings and tuples are immutable, while dictionaries and lists are mutable.

Objects are never explicitly destroyed; however, when they become unreachable they may be
garbage-collected. An implementation is allowed to postpone garbage collection or omit it
altogether — it is a matter of implementation quality how garbage collection is implemented,
as long as no objects are collected that are still reachable.


Some objects contain references to other objects; these are called containers.
Examples of containers are tuples, lists and dictionaries. The references are part of a container’s value.


In most cases, when we talk about the value of a container, we imply the values,
not the identities of the contained objects; however, when we talk about the mutability
of a container, only the identities of the immediately contained objects are implied.
So, if an immutable container (like a tuple) contains a reference to a mutable object,
its value changes if that mutable object is changed.

l = [1,2,3]
tup = ['a', 'b', l]
print(tup)
l[0]=[4,5,6]
print(tup)
#why l=[4,5,6] not work?

##types
"""
Types affect almost all aspects of object behavior. Even the importance of object identity
is affected in some sense: for immutable types, operations that compute new values may
actually return a reference to any existing object with the same type and value,
while for mutable objects this is not allowed. E.g., after a = 1; b = 1, a and b may or
may not refer to the same object with the value one, depending on the implementation,
but after c = []; d = [], c and d are guaranteed to refer to two different, unique,
newly created empty lists. (Note that c = d = [] assigns the same object to both c and d.)

##list of types

###callable types
"""
These are the types to which the function call operation (see section Calls) can be applied:

    User-defined functions
----------------------------------
Attributes and its Meaning
 __doc__   func_doc
 __name__  func_name
 __module__  The name of the module the function was defined in, or None if unavailable.
 __defaults__  func_defaults
 __code__ func_code
 __globals__  func_globals
 __dict__  func_dict 函数是对象，所以也可以有属性
 __closure__  None or a tuple of cells that contain bindings for the function’s free variables.
